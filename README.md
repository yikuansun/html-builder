### Note - if you're okay with using a command line tool, I'd recommend using [html-builder-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-builder-cli) instead. It's way faster and more consistent.

# HTML Builder
Effortlessly create desktop apps out of HTML, CSS, and JS.

Runs on [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron). [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) must be installed to use HTML Builder.
